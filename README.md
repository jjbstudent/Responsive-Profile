## Project Overview
This week's project involves the development of a dynamic portfolio page that will serve as a showcase of my skills and accomplishments throughout the course. The primary goal is to create a visually appealing and functional portfolio that not only highlights my technical abilities but also provides insight into my thought processes behind the showcased work.

1. **Skill Demonstration:** Showcase your proficiency in applying recently learned core skills, including flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.
2. **Career Preparation:** Lay the foundation for future success in your career search by creating a portfolio that stands out to potential employers.
3. **Deployed Projects:** Emphasize the importance of having several deployed projects by creating a live portfolio page, demonstrating practical application to prospective employers.

## Features
- **Core Skills:** Apply flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables to create a responsive and visually appealing portfolio.
- **Placeholder Content:** In case there are not enough web applications to showcase, use placeholder images and names with the flexibility to update them later in the course.
- **Thought Processes:** Include sections or annotations that explain the thought processes behind each showcased work.
- **Wireframe layout** - See image below for responsive wireframe webpage layout
